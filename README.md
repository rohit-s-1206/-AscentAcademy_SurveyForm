# -AscentAcademy_SurveyForm
Survey form to gather information from the users. This could be feedback, information from customers, or data for research purposes. You employ HTML to build the structure of your survey form and to create the fields the users have to fill (name, age, gender, details of contact). CSS is for  styling. JavaScript is for tasks associated with validation such as e-mail ID and character limit.
